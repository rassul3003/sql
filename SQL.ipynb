    "Which cuisines tend to have a disproportionate number of what which violations? Answering this question isn't easy because you have to think carefully about normalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. More popular cuisine categories will tend to have more violations just because they represent more restaurants.\n",
    "2. Similarly, some violations are more common.  For example, knowing that \"Equipment not easily movable or sealed to floor\" is a common violation for Chinese restaurants is not particularly helpful when it is a common violation for all restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right quantity is to look at is the conditional probability of a specific type of violation given a specific cuisine type and divide it by the unconditional probability of the violation for the entire population. Taking this ratio gives the right answer.  Return the 20 highest ratios of the form:\n",

    "**Hint:**\n",
    "1. You might want to check out this [Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/972877/calculate-frequency-using-sql).\n",
    "2. The definition of a violation changes with time.  For example, 10A can mean two different things \"Toilet facility not maintained ...\" or \"Vermin or other live animal present ...\" when things were prior to 2003. To deal with this, you should limit your analysis to violation codes with end date after Jan 1, 2014. (This end date refers to the validity time ranges in `violations` table).\n",
    "3. The ratios don't mean much when the number of violations of a given type and for a specific category are not large (why not?).  We chose 100 as our cutoff.  We include these categories in the statistics calculations, but do not report their values.\n",
